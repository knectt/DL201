Pandas, as a data wrangling tool, brings this to the next level.\n\nThere is nothing new about this, and everyone knows that indexes are a part of everyday life.\n\n***Indexes are everywhere***\n\nWhen you read a book, the page number is an index. \nA book, also, has an index called an ISBN, which allows libraries to identify and categorize books.\n\nPostal codes are also indices which allow for the efficient delivery of mails.\n\nHave you  more examples of indices? \n\n***Definition*** : Indexing can be defined as the act of classifying and providing an index in order to make items easier to retrieve.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 1: Indexing Tabular Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The pandas library shines in how it is able to index data.

Then, with each column, we can access it through this method. \n\nAs you'll see below, Pandas Columns are essentially a layer of metadata, which is tied to each of the features which makes it very straightforward to access and manipulate the data assigned to them.

When you remove samples from your dataset, this number will change, and if it does your code might break. If you remove samples from your dataframe, it is good to do this sooner rather than later.\n\n***The second number is the width***, which is the most important number to pay attention to in pandas. If you get an unexpected number, then it means that your data has not loaded correctly.

It contains elements of many existing programs such as SAS, SQL, Excel, and R which people are familiar with and be able to pick up and get familiar with pandas quickly","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.3 Exercises : Explore the usage of known and conditional indexes in Numpy arrays.\n<hr style=\"border:2px solid gray\"> </hr>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 1: Load a sample image\nimage_object = Image.open(IMAGE_DIR/\"week1/Rubiks_cube.jpg\")  # Notice this time we include the path to the image\ndisplay(image_object)","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 2: Load a 12.5% resized version of the image into a numpy array\n\n# Resize the image \nimage_object = image_object.resize((int(image_object.width/8), int(image_object.height/8)))\ndisplay(image_object)\n\nimage_data = np.array(image_object)\nimage_width, image_height = image_data.shape[:2]\nprint('Image shape:', image_data.shape)","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code cells below allow to practice indexing and slicing in NumPy arrays.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 3: Define a few examples of scalar-based ranges for indexing\n\n# Make the top of the image black\nimage_1 = image_data.copy()\nimage_1[:image_height//2, :, :] = 0\ndisplay(Image.fromarray(image_1))   # Display the image, notice the conversion to PIL image","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make one third of the image height black\nimage_2 = image_data.copy()\nimage_2[:, :image_height//3, :] = 0\ndisplay(Image.fromarray(image_2))","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define an artificial grid of 3x3 based on the image size\nimage_3 = image_data.copy()\ngrid_rows = 3\ngrid_columns = 3\ncell_width = int(image_width / grid_columns)\ncell_height = int(image_height / grid_rows)\ngrid_positions = [[] for _ in range(grid_rows * grid_columns)]\n\n# Make the first and the last cells black\ncell_1 = image_3[:cell_width, :cell_height, :]\ncell_1[:] = 0                                       # Notice this array-wise selection\n\ncell_9 = image_3[cell_width * 2:, cell_height * 2:, :]\ncell_9[:] = 0\ndisplay(Image.fromarray(image_3))","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"for the last 3x3 grid example above, try to define the other 7 remaining cells or better yet, define a function that creates a MxN grid and generate the array positions for any of the cells.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 4: Define a few examples of array-based indexing\n\n# Introduce horizontal and vertical black bars on the image\nimage_4 = image_data.copy()\nnumber_bars = 10\n\nhorizonta_bars = np.linspace(0, image_height, number_bars)       \nhorizonta_bars = horizonta_bars.astype(int)\nprint(f'horizontal bars indexes: {horizonta_bars}')\nimage_4[horizonta_bars[:-1], :, :] = 0\ndisplay(Image.fromarray(image_4))\n\nvertical_bars = np.linspace(0, image_width, number_bars)         \nvertical_bars = vertical_bars.astype(int)\nimage_4[:, vertical_bars[:-1], :] = 0\ndisplay(Image.fromarray(image_4))","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For the example above, how would you control the thickness (in array elements or pixels) of the bar?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 5: Define a few examples for condition-based indexing (for unknown indexes)\n\n# Find the array indexes of pixels with high values for the green\nimage_5 = image_data.copy()\nvalue_threshold = 200\n\nimage_5[np.where(image_data[:, :, 1] >= value_threshold)] = 0\ndisplay(Image.fromarray(image_5))\n\n# Modify the condition so it does not affects the background\nimage_6 = image_data.copy()\nvalue_threshold = 120\nimage_6[np.where((image_data[:, :, 1] >= value_threshold) & (image_data[:, :, 0] < value_threshold) & (image_data[:, :, 2] < value_threshold) )] = 0\ndisplay(Image.fromarray(image_6))\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Follow up:\n- How would you control the thickness of the bar in pixels?\n- Attempt to recreate the grid of MxN cells in a different way, scramble the cells and produce a puzzle-like image.\n- Create diagonal lines in the image or \"crop\" a traingle or diamond shape from the image (black color)","metadata":{}}]}
